# Interfacing-of-an-IR-sensor-array-with-various-modules

In this project, I designed a Double-Sided PCB and combined the aspects of Hardware/Software Interfacing.
As an object moves closer/away, there is a fluctuation in the sensor's output voltage. This sensor can be used to get a raw ADC value, and with this ADC value, we can change the PWM value of the desired component. We can show various readings such as PWM and ADC values on an LCD.

Here's the link to demo of the project - https://youtu.be/a0eIPZO33nk
